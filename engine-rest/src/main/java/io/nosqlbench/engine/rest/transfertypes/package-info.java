/**
 * Types in this package are meant to provide a mapping
 * between internal state and external views. Specifically,
 * these types should only include details which are meant to
 * be shared by endpoints. This can be achieved by wrapping
 * internal state and exposing only the visible properties, or
 * it can be done by implementing types which are built from
 * common internal types.
 *
 * Service objects in the services package should only provide
 * primitive values or the view types from this package.
