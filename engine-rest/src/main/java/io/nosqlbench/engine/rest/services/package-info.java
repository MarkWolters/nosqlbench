/**
 * Classes in this package are meant to provide a basic

 * This simplifies endpoint implementations and facilitates DRY
 * implementations.
 *
 * These implementations should only expose primitive types,
 * collections of primitive types, or views of transfer types
 * as implemented in that package.
