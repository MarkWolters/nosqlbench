/**
 * <p>A DriverSpaceCache is simply a place to hold something like a
 * client instance and all associated objects for quick and easy access. Each
 * space cache is simply a named and separate cache of objects. This is provided
 * as a convenient way to keep object state around which may be needed during the
 * course of executing operations with a driver or API. By naming each space, it
 * becomes possible for tests to create and use separate logical instances of
 * a client API for advanced testing. The default instance should simply be named
 * {@code default}</p>
 *
 * <p>Most native drivers use some combination of fluent, functional, and declarative
 * patterns. These usually require you to keep access to a set of core
 * state-holding objects in order to construct new elements to drive operations with.
 * An example of this would be creating a statement from a session. It is necessary
 * to keep the session around in for when you create new statements. Maintaining
 * the session object is considered an essential part of idiomatic and efficient
 * use of the API. Further, you may have builders or factories that are created
 * from the session which should be cached as well. Keeping all these objects
 * together requires attaching them to a cohesive owning object -- That is the space
 * cache.</p>
 *
 * <p>You might want to create multiple session contexts in order to test out
 * non-trivial behavior in advanced testing scenarios. To do this dynamically, i.e.
 * acquire some named space cache, simply call the {@link #get(String)}</p> method
 * with the name of the space you want to use. This value can be provided as a
 * dynamic field in your op mapping ({@link OpMapper})
 * or synthesis ({@link OpDispenser})
 * implementation.
 *
 * @param <S> The type which will represent the cache for a given type of adapter.
